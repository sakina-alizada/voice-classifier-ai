# Voice Detection and Categorization using AI
### Deep Learning System for Voice-Based Emotion and Category Recognition

This research project, developed as part of my PhD work, focuses on detecting and classifying human voice samples based on emotion, tone, and speech category. The system uses advanced feature extraction techniques and deep neural networks to achieve high accuracy across diverse datasets.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an end-to-end AI model for voice emotion detection.
- Analyze frequency, pitch, and MFCC features to classify speech.
- Support cross-language voice recognition and categorization.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python  
**Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch  
**Libraries:** Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Model Type:** CNN + LSTM Hybrid

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Noise reduction, normalization, and segmentation.  
2. **Feature Extraction:** MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Contrast, and Tonnetz.  
3. **Model Training:** CNN-LSTM architecture for temporal-spatial learning.  
4. **Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1-score metrics.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **92% accuracy** in detecting emotional tone (happy, sad, angry, neutral).  
- Tested on multilingual datasets for cross-cultural robustness.

---

## 🧠 Future Work
- Integrate real-time voice detection module.
- Expand dataset diversity for cross-gender and multi-accent detection.
